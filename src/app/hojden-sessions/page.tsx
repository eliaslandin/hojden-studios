            Workshop on basic light and sound tech for performing arts. We will use the equipment available at höjden with the aim to make you feel comfortable using it. We will also look at lights and through some easy steps create space for exciting light situations to happen.<br/>
            <br/>
            There will be room for the participants to come with input and we will shape the workshop according to the participants needs and desires - both technical aspects and questions around lighting design at large.<br/>
            <br/>
            The workshop is held by Ronald Salas, who has a degree in stage production and tech from Malmö University and a degree in lighting design from Stockholm University of the Arts. He  works mainly with lights for dance, opera and theatre but also installations.

            Lisa Schåman is interested in different ways of describing dance, from a personal to a theoretical perspective. In this workshop she proposes to study dance through activities such as reading, writing, observing and dancing. Through centering the role of the witness, the workshop experiments with proximities between the witness and the dance. What can a witness testify and how can their experience be transcribed?<br/>
            <br/>
            Lisa Schåman is a dancer based in Stockholm. Recently she's been performing within Malin Elgan's works and is currently engaged in choreographic processes by Peter Mills respectively Oda Brekke. Since receiving a BA degree in dance (UniArts Stockholm 2015) she enthusiastically continues to develop and unfold her interest in dance e.g. studies in aesthetics (Södertörn 2020-21), or, together with Brekke co-hosting a study circle on choreography, ”Koreograferade Perspektiv” (Hägerstensåsens Medborgarhus 2023-24).

            This workshop invites performers and everyone who is curious to explore how to make a space that moves us. We will imagine situations and predicaments and let our body deepdive into the affect they propose. Totally non-pathological, one hundred percent aesthetic realness. We will engage with practices from my later works and make up some new ones together as we go along. Maybe we even make a little piece? <br/>
            <br/>
            Very open level, all interested in performance very welcome. <br/>
            <br/>
            We imagine it then it happens through meditation, movement and attention. <br/>
            <br/>
            Bring clothes you are comfortable to both move and rest in!

            during these 3 days, we will be dancing scores about love and spending time with a bunch of organs, emerging from and into the in and the out. these organs don't have vital functions and don't feel like being named either. they are in continuous development and decay, and every time we dance, they change. we will be dancing with and through these organs to cultivate a space a little sensuous and kind of erotic, where fantasy does matter, matter does fantasy, and where every actant (including you over there) is just a sidekick. <br/>
